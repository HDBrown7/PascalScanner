# Scanner for a Simplified Pascal language
Lexical scanner from my Automata Theory class that prints the token numbers and the lines that they appear on from some small "programs".  The simplified Pascal language only supports
integers and the 4 basic arithmetic operators.  Further, it only supports a FOR loop and can do simple input and output through READ and WRITE.  Eventually I intend to add the parser.  

- [] getToken needs to return the token numbers
- [] Hashing needs to be updated
