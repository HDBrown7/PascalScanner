# Scanner for a Simplified Pascal language
Fun little scanner from CS 421 that prints the token numbers and the lines that they appear on from some small "programs".  The simplified Pascal language only supports
integers and the 4 basic arithmetic operators.  Further, it only supports the FOR loop and can do simple input and output through READ and WRITE.  Super simple but I 
would like to adapt this so that I can eventually make the parser to accompany it.  

- [] getToken needs to return the token numbers
- [] Hashing needs to be updated
